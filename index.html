            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>
                I am a third year electrical engineering student attempting to learn programming in my spare time, starting with web
                development. This means any free time or coffee breaks that I have are always paired with working on a coding project,
                learning from online resources or reading “Think like a programmer” by V. Anton Spraul.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m definitely still a work in progress, but if you’re looking to hire a co-op student who is <strong>motivated, willing to
                learn and a problem solver</strong> then look no further…I’m Hiruni and it’s lovely to meet you.

                <h2 id="journey-link">My Journey to Learning Programming</h2>
                    <p>
                        During my formal education, starting with Physics at the University of Waterloo (not complete) to now doing Engineering
                        at the University of Ottawa, I have learnt and used multiple programming languages (Python, C++, JavaScript) in my
                        classes. Unfortunately though, I never really understood how these programs could be used outside of the IDE to make
                        meaningful real-world applications.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This was always the case, until I found an open-source project based coding curriculum, known as The Odin Project.
                        Creating the projects in this course have taught me a multitude of new skills such as: command line basics, version
                        control using Git, using HTML and CSS to create landing pages, etc. Now with my spark for learning programming regnited
                        I have ventured out into new material, such as CS50x to learn how to think algorithmically and solve problems
                        efficiently, and I’ll continue to look for more online resources.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The journey to becoming a good programmer never ends. I can always work towards expanding my toolset and knowledge and
                        all I can say about that is…I’ve never been more excited!
                    </p>
